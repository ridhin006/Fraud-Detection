# Fraud-Detection
## üìå Project Overview
This capstone project focuses on developing a **fraud detection system** using various machine learning models to classify fraudulent transactions. The project involved **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and optimization** to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

## üîç Key Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ EDA & Data Processing
- Analyzed transaction patterns and trends.
- Handled missing values and removed outliers.
- Engineered new features to enhance model performance.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection & Training
- Implemented and compared multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Validation & Performance Evaluation
- Applied **K-Fold Cross-Validation** for model stability.
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization & Deployment
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters for better performance.
- Explored potential deployment strategies for real-world use.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
